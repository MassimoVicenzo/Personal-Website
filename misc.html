                <p>Every day I do the crossword on <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/today">Puzzmo</a>, unlike most other crosswords I've done, these don't usually require you to know the name of every actor/actress or author. Also they can give hints for each clue.</p>
                
                <p>Speaking of crosswords, eventually I hope to graduate to cryptic crosswords. <a href="https://www.minutecryptic.com/">Minute Cryptic</a> is a single cryptic crossword puzzle to solve each day and even has video explanations of how you could arrive at the solution. They even have a guide on how to solve regular cryptic puzzles so I would definitely recommend checking it out if you like wordplay.</p>
